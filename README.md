# ScanAlert-Pi 🚨🎥
**An intelligent Raspberry Pi + Arduino-based system for smart object detection using a servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor. It captures images, sends email alerts, and activates LED + buzzer when an object is detected.**

## 🔧 Features

- 🔁 Sweeping motion using servo motor (Arduino)
- 🧠 Object detection using HC-SR04 (Ultrasonic Sensor)
- 📸 Captures an image on detection using Raspberry Pi Camera
- 📧 Sends real-time email alert with captured image
- 🔊 Buzzer + LED alert system
- 🔗 Raspberry Pi and Arduino serial communication

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Arduino

* Connect the servo to pin D6
* Connect the HC-SR04 sensor to pins D9 (TRIG) and D10 (ECHO)
* Upload `servo_sweep_detection.ino` sketch
* HC-SR04 detects object → sends "ALERT" to Raspberry Pi over Serial

### Raspberry Pi

* Connect the LED to GPIO17 (Physical pin 11) through 100Ω resistor
* Connect the buzzer to GPIO25 (Physical pin 22)
* Connect camera module and enable `libcamera`
* Clone the project and install dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
pip install yagmail
```

* Make sure your Gmail App Password is generated and added in the script
* Run the Python script:

```bash
python3 iotproject.py
```

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Arduino sweeps the servo back and forth.
2. HC-SR04 checks distance.
3. If object detected (e.g., <15 cm), it sends **"ALERT"** to Raspberry Pi.
4. Raspberry Pi:

   * Lights up LED and buzzer
   * Captures image via camera
   * Sends an email with the photo attached
5. After sending, Pi replies with **"R"** (resume) to Arduino, and sweep continues.

## 🧠 Possible Enhancements

* Object tracking with motor movement
* Facial recognition before alerting
* Logging detection timestamps to a file or database
* Telegram or WhatsApp integration
